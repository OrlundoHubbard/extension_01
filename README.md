# The browser extension hub

I had this notion of building a coalition that pumps out browser extensions. Kind of like an incubator for browser extensions. I think that the browser extension space is extremely underserved for the amount of developers that are in the technology ecosystem. I see the opportunity as sort of a blue ocean. One approach to take is that of taking what is already being done in the browsers and form them into extensions.

## The current extension

This is the first of the series of extensions. This will be sort of practice. I have been currently sifting through different repositories to see what is possible and what ideas are out there.

## Imitate, then Innovate

The first state of the extensions will be imitiations, with slight alterations. I'm of the firm belief that when you're learning, the quickest path is to imitate and then innovate. Not everyone has grand ideas right from the start. No need to reinvent the wheel, take what's already there and work with that.
